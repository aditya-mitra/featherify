![Featherify Logo](./client/public/images/logo_original_uncropped.png)

Featherify is an extremely fast and highly customizable generator of your **high-quality image**. If you don't like to _compress_ or _minify_ your image in your apps, Featherify might just be thing you were looking for.

![Working Demo](./client/public/images/working_demo)

Featherify offers two interfaces for you to generate a substitute for your image.

- The webapp _(image above)_ which has a cool looking interface for you to generate _feathers_(aka. image substitute) for your image in the browser or webapp itself.

Check it out here -> _(Hosted on AWS Amplify)_

- The API which you can use to convert your images during your _build time_ of your application.
